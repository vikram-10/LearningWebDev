<center><h1>JSON vs XML</h1></center>

<p>Greetings reader, this is my take and my views as to which technology i prefer, JSON or XML, these two object notations are widely used nowadays widely in API calls for information interchange, although XML is not widely used a lot nowadays and was mainly predominant in the days when SOAP(Simple Object Acccess Protocol) was used.
Personally as much as I'd like to say that i like JSON because it is new, i feel in some ways, XML is way better; since the objects are enclosed within tags(<xyz>), there is much much less possibility to make errors, whereas in JSON, the items are referenced using 'key-value pairs' and hence, the possibility of making errors is comparitively high...
But also due to the presence of 'key-value pairs', Referencing object values might be much easier when compared to XML where one might have a headache searching between the 
tags. These are the main key differences i have found from online sources:
<h3>KEY DIFFERENCES:</h3>
<li>JSON object has a type whereas XML data is typeless.</li>
<li>JSON does not provide namespace support while XML provides namespaces support.</li>
<li>JSON has no display capabilities whereas XML offers the capability to display data.</li>
<li>JSON is less secured whereas XML is more secure compared to JSON.</li>
<li>JSON supports only UTF-8 encoding whereas XML supports various encoding formats.</li>
