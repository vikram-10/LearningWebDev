<center><h1>Objects</h1></center>
<center><h4>This is a brief blog about objects and it's internal representation present in JavaScript</h4></center>
<p>In JavaScript, most of the elements except primitive datatypes such as number,boolean,string etc. are known as objects in JS. Some main representation of objects are enclosed within brackets such as '[]' and '{}' priitive datatypes are string,number and boolean whereas some trivial datatypes are null and undefined, the rest can be visualised as objects. These objects are generally a collection of variables that can be easily referenced from an outer call with the help of a 'key' or an 'index'. Which are important to reference the variable elements from the objects, JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) is a very prominent example of Objects in Js. From y reading about objects in Stack overflow i was surprised to see that objects are represented differently in internal memory from what i expected! There are 2 main modes an object can have : <ul><li>Dictionary Mode
</li><li>Fast Mode</li></ul> Objects are generally stored in Fast mode such as Structs in C, whereas in Dictionary mode, it is found that objects are stored as hash maps and objects are also internally referenced from these 'hashmaps' but this effectes the overall performance...
Therefore, acessing elements in dictionary mode is comparitively faster than in Fast mode as it is easily referenced using hash maps</p>
