    <h1>VIKRAM BALAJI</h1>
    <h2>About ME</h2>
    <p>Hello My Name is Vikram Balaji and I'm an aspiring full stack developer. I intend to learn this course so that i 
        can build websites for businesses and probably start my own business website someday too! I started out this way, but ended up loving the toics in it once i started digging a bit deeper. I am currently enrolled in Guvi's Full Stack Development Bootcamp and i really love the environment here. It makes me come out of my comfort zone and actually realise how many students from all around India I'm competing with... I really used to take getting placed for granted, but only after joining here i realise how important and competitive it is.
    Apart from this, i love reading books, i'm a huge pet lover and own a pet Labrador. I have a very huge intrest in Cars and Bikes and hope to buy a luxurious one for myself someday...</p>
