The GET and POST methods are two different methods that are used for sending and recieving data from the browsers. The GET method is generally used while requesting for data (static webpages)
where no information is required to be submitted. 
This is because the information submitted via a form or a Login appears as parameters that are appended to the URL string. 
whereas in the case of POST, the information submitted is passed along with the message body; hence it is much more secure as it canoot be seen. 
Going BACK on a GET request does not pose any consequences, whereas pressing BACK on a post request will result in resubmission of the form or login.
The GET requests can easily be bookmarked, whereas that's not the case for POST requests.
The GET requests remain in the browser history whereas POST requests do not appear in the History.
The GET requests have certain length restrictions, whereas POST requests do not have such. 
The datatype passed through GET is only ASCII whereas POST requests can also handle binary
