Upon exploring,these are the new tags that are introduced in HTML 5 lately:
<ul>

<li>aside  -Represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the rest of the page.</li>
<li>audio -Defines an audio file.</li>
<li>canvas -This is used for rendering dynamic bitmap graphics on the fly, such as graphs or games.</li>
<li>command -Represents a command the user can invoke.</li>
<li>datalist -Together with the a new list attribute for input can be used to make comboboxes</li>
<li>details -Represents additional information or controls which the user can obtain on demand</li>

<li>figure -Represents a piece of self-contained flow content, typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.</li>

<li>time -Represents a date and/or time.</li>

</ul>  
My finding as to why these were introduced is because, as a lot of people have started to learn HTML to create front-end websites to showcase their content, HTML5 has made this 
easier for those people by introducing this kind of much efficient tags in order to make development easier.
It also reduces the amount of code required by bringing in new tags with built in features, for eg. people trying to create blog posts can now easily partition their blogs by
putting it under an <article> tag instead of creating a <div> tag and aligning it to meet the requirements of the page.
